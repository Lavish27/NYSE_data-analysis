# NYSE_data-analysis
Analysing New York Stock Exchange data for better predictions.

In this project the covariance of the data of different stock symbols is found using hive and visualisation in the form of a plot using python(pandas , matplotlib) is done.
A positive covariance means asset returns move together and negative covariance means asset returns move in opposite direction.Analysing frequent changes in covariance, accurate predictions can be made in buying and selling shares.
Here we have used NYSE data in nysedata.csv file and hive script in nyse_HIVESCRIPT.docx , the result table is nyse_result.csv and the python script nyse_python.docx.
